Awesome right? But behind the scenes\nis the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an\nenormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in\nLondon over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food,\ndespite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years\nand we operate in 12 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from\n50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.  \n  \nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you\nhave a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We\nare providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and\nrestaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the\nfreedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.  \n  \nWe work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most\ncomplex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time.\nMillions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to\nmatch them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the\nsecret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.  \n  \nAnd we\u2019re just getting started  \n  \nThe scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is\nvalued at \u00a37.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that\nwith the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and\ntravel to retail and communications - it\u2019s clear that our journey in the food\nsector has only just begun.  \n  \nWe are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in\nsize every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT\u2019s\u2019 list of Europe\u2019s fastest\ngrowing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win\nDeloitte\u2019s \u2018UK Top 50\u2019 two years in a row.
