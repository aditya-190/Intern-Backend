We operate one of the most\\ncomplex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time.\\nMillions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to\\nmatch them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the\\nsecret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.  \\n  \\nAnd we\\u2019re just getting started  \\n  \\nThe scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is\\nvalued at \\u00a37.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that\\nwith the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and\\ntravel to retail and communications - it\\u2019s clear that our journey in the food\\nsector has only just begun.  \\n  \\nWe are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in\\nsize every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT\\u2019s\\u2019 list of Europe\\u2019s fastest\\ngrowing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win\\nDeloitte\\u2019s \\u2018UK Top 50\\u2019 two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value\\nthis company will generate lies ahead of us.  \\n  \\nThe Role  \\n  \\nYou\\u2019ll work as part of our rapidly growing product team building robust,\\nmaintainable and beautiful Android applications for our rider, restaurant and\\nconsumer teams. You'll take part in decisions related to how we undertake new\\nprojects and gather requirements to scope out projects with the rest of the\\nteam. We're looking for people who enjoy mentoring others, like tackling\\nproblems collaboratively and working closely with product managers and other\\nengineers to create polished solutions. Our applications have an MVP\\narchitecture using RxJava and Dagger and we're well underway to convert all\\nAndroid applications to 100% Kotlin.  \\n  \\nRequirements  \\n  \\n\\n  \\u2022  We want to emphasise that we don't expect you to meet all of the below:\\n  \\u2022  Take pride in readable, well-designed, well-tested software\\n  \\u2022  Experience in building Android applications at scale\\n  \\u2022  4+ years of work experience with in Android development\\n  \\u2022  Kotlin and/or Java experience\\n  \\u2022  Accomplished in scaling Android architecture\\n  \\u2022  Experience with Android development tools like Android Studio\\n  \\u2022  Experience working in a cross-functional team\\n  \\u2022  Knowledge of the Android SDK and AndroidX\\n  \\u2022  Interested in writing Kotlin\\n  \\u2022  A bias for action and pragmatism over perfection  \\n  \\n\\nLife at Deliveroo  \\n  \\nWe are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the\\nmost interesting questions out there. We move fast, we\\u2019re always looking for\\nnew ideas and we\\u2019re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we\\nmake them.  \\n  \\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven\\u2019t even\\nencountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer\\nhabits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long\\nbefore the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some\\nof the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot\\nbe yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for\\ngrowth and personal impact is enormous.\\n\\n\"},\n{\"companyLogo\": \"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHHmRgEadFrdA/company-logo_100_100/0/1611250856145?e=1653523200&v=beta&t=uBeGnwuiMgJNvV3Br02LAJLH_DwcRxsO3NRppOp3w68\", \"companyName\": \"Qualcomm\", \"postTitle\": \"Android Power Engineer\", \"jobTitle\": \"Android Power Engineer\", \"jobLocation\": \"Hyderabad, Telangana, India\", \"lastUpdated\": 1645256435, \"jobDuration\": \"Nothing Here\", \"aboutCompany\": \"Nothing Here\", \"applyNowPage\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2923200598?url=https%3A%2F%2Fqualcomm%2Ewd5%2Emyworkdayjobs%2Ecom%2FExternal%2Fjob%2FHyderabad-IND%2FAndroid-Power-Engineer_3028249%3Fsource%3DAPPLICANT_SOURCE-6-2&urlHash=Zm3z&refId=ZP0N9KrcoG8o7uG4r6iOwg%3D%3D%3D%3D&trackingId=3RmSA7gS5zb%2FoJma2+9iIg%3D%3D%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite\", \"postDescription\": \"Company  \\n  \\nQualcomm India Private Limited  \\n  \\nJob Area  \\n  \\nEngineering Group, Engineering Group > Software Engineering  \\n  \\nGeneral Summary  \\n  \\nQualcomm Snapdragon SOC\\u2019s long battery life is built on industry leading power\\nmanagement architectures.
